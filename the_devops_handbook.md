# The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations

## Preface

Various authors talk about their journey to the DevOps "ephiphany".

**Gene Kim**
**Jezz Humble**
**Patrick Debois**
**John Willis**

> Given our belief that DevOps is a manifestation of creating dynamic, learning organizations that continually reinforce high-trust cultural norms, it is inevitable that these organizations will continue to innovate and win in the marketplace.


### Myths

1. DevOps is only for start-ups.
2. DevOps replaces agile.
3. DevOps is incompatible with ITIL.
4. DevOps is incompatible with Information Security and Compliance.
5. DevOps means eliminiating IT Operations, or "NoOps".
6. DevOps is just "Infrastructure as Code" or automation
7. DevOps is only for Open Source software.

## Forward

Done by John Allspaw, the CTO of Etsy. Presented the original _[Ten Deploys a Day][]_ presentation which was revolutionary at the time.

He has since to move on and form his own company, [Adaptive Capacity Labs LLC][], along with Dr. David Woods and Dr. Richard Cook. This is super interesting because it is essentially former CTO who took their research and applied it to operations.

> In order for a field or discipline to progress and mature, it needs to reach a point where it can thoughtfully reflect on its origins, seek out a diverse set of perspectives on those reflections, and place that synthesis into a context that is useful for how the community pictures the future.

## Introduction - Imagine a World Where Dev and Ops Became DevOps

> By adding the expertise of QA, IT Operations, and Infosec into delivery teams and automated self-service tools and platforms, teams are able to use that expertise in their daily work without being dependent on other teams.

Small teams are able to develop, test, and deploy code quicker with higher quality because they are doing these things at the beginning of the process.

Lean practices have had a significant improvement on lead times in manufacturing. Since the 1980's, starting in 2005, the adoption of Lean has dropped average lead times by more than 95% (Location 522).

Software development is under similar demands. "During the 1970s and 1980s, most new features required one to five years to develop and deploy, often costing tens of millions of dollars (Location 522).

If you can't change quickly it puts you at a disadvantage to the rest of the competition.

> It is virtually impossible to make any business decision that doesn’t result in at least one IT change.

> Consider the following calculation— both IDC and Gartner estimated that in 2011, approximately 5% of the worldwide gross domestic product ($ 3.1 trillion) was spent on IT (hardware, services, and telecom). If we estimate that 50% of that $ 3.1 trillion was spent on operating costs and maintaining existing systems, and that one-third of that 50% was spent on urgent and unplanned work or rework, approximately $ 520 billion was wasted.

If software is not at the core of your business then you are probably in trouble.

> When we increase the number of developers, individual developer productivity often significantly decreases due to communication, integration, and testing overhead.
