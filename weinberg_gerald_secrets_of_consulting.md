## Sherby's Laws of Consulting

### The First Law

In spite of what your client may tell you, there's always a problem.

Clients aren't forthright in admitting there is a problem. This is typical in management where if a manager admits something is wrong then they are admitting they can't handle the problem themselves.

#### The Ten Percent Promise

If sick people can't be cured because they won't admit that they are sick this is a huge problem for consultants. A way to better frame the situation is make the client feel competent and look for areas of improvement.

> if you promise too much improvement they will never hire you, because that would force them to admit that they have a problem.

### The Second Law

No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem.

### The Third Law

Never forget they're paying you by the hour, not by the solution.

here is a problem then they may be seen as incompetent.
